### Main Themes In this course

 Eps && MainThemes | Description && Tips
------------- | -------------
Ep 1: Classes | Classes are the blueprints of objects & class contains both data (variables) & functions that form a package called an: 'object'.
Ep 2: Getters and Setters | G&S are the principal way to get and set properties for security reasons & organization.
Ep 3: Encapsulation | Encapsulation is a concept of wrapping-up some data in a single unit & other good part of Encapsulation is that you can make a class read only or read only using setters & getters.
Ep 4: Inheritance | Is a concept of creating functions that will be used from other children classes.
Ep 5: empty | empty
Ep 6: empty | empty
Ep 7: empty | empty
Ep 8: Interfaces | Interfaces are basically a "contract" that the class who implements it sign to.
Ep 9: Interfaces vs Abstract | Mostly they are very similar both can create a "contract" with the class that implements or extends it but abstract classes can have some functionality & and interfaces are just "contracts".
